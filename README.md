The main targets of this script are users of the android version of ES-DE. Especially those who are moving from EmulationStation.

This script recursively runs chdman in a multi folder environment where .bin and .cue/.gdi files are organized in game specific folders.
The script will create a .chd file in the root folder. 

If a multi-disc game is found, the script will create the .chd file in a .hidden folder.
An .m3u file will also be created in the root folder.

Don't forget to place chdman.exe in the same directory as chdmandir.exe.
